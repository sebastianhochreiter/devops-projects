# Automated Build and Deployment Pipeline

## Detailed Project Description
The Automated Build and Deployment Pipeline project aimed to automate the process of code compilation, testing, and deployment, thereby increasing the efficiency of the development cycle and reducing human error.

### 1. The Business Challenge
- Frequent manual deployments are time-consuming and prone to errors, affecting productivity and the overall quality of releases. Automating this process can increase speed and reliability.

### 2. The Technical Challenge
- The challenge involved integrating various tools and technologies into a seamless pipeline that covers everything from code commit to deployment.
- Requirements included version control, automated build tools, automated testing, and automated deployment, all orchestrated together.

### 3. The Process
- Used Git for version control, Jenkins for build automation, Selenium for automated testing, and Kubernetes for deployment.
- Set up Jenkins jobs to automatically fetch code from the Git repository and build the application.
- Integrated Selenium for automated testing post-build.
- Set up a Kubernetes cluster for automated deployment.
- Technologies involved were Git, Jenkins, Selenium, and Kubernetes.

### 4. The Results
- Achieved a 40% reduction in the time taken from code commit to deployment.
- Errors due to manual processes were virtually eliminated, increasing the reliability of releases.
