# Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for Environment Provisioning

## Detailed Project Description
The Infrastructure as Code project aimed to automate the provisioning and management of servers, databases, and other infrastructure components, allowing for easy replication of environments and version control for infrastructure configurations.

### 1. The Business Challenge
- Setting up new environments manually is slow and prone to inconsistencies, leading to the well-known "it works on my machine" problem. IaC addresses this by making environment setups reproducible and automated.

### 2. The Technical Challenge
- The challenge involved writing scripts that can automatically set up and configure required infrastructure elements.
- Requirements included defining server configurations, database setups, and network configurations in code, stored in version control.

### 3. The Process
- Chose Terraform for infrastructure provisioning and Ansible for configuration management.
- Wrote Terraform scripts to define the required cloud resources.
- Used Ansible playbooks to configure the servers post-provisioning.
- Stored all scripts and playbooks in a Git repository for version control.
- Technologies used were Terraform, Ansible, and Git.

### 4. The Results
- The time taken to provision new environments was reduced by over 60%.
- Environments are now consistent and easily replicable, leading to fewer configuration-related errors during development and testing.
